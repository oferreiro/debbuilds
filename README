This is only another personal package scripts to manage small server without RVM (I don't like RVM on my single server).
I found a way to make package on debian, using checkinstall. But everytime when I tried this command it was failed. (bug?)
Then I decide find another way to make this.
This scripts works similar with slackbuils, but to debian distros.
To get help just execute the scrip with param -h.
I included some scripts to clean system and tools to protect server from dictionary ssh attack.

How to use:
-----------
Download nginx-1x (http://nginx.org) and ruby-1.9.x (http://ruby.org).
Put on their work directory.
Enter on directory and execute build.sh script.
./build.sh compile  :to uncompress and compile sources.
./build.sh pkg  :to generate a .deb pkg.
./build.sh clean :I think you know.
sudo ./build.sh dep :to install dependencies.

To install just use dpkg -i your.deb

If you want remove all files installed use dpkg -r yourpkg
If you really need remove all things use uninstall.sh

Bug reports and suggestions are appreciated.

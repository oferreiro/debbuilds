This is only another personal package scripts to manage small server.
I found a way to make package on debian, using checkinstall. But everytime when I tried this command it was failed. (bug?)
Then I decide find another way to make this.
This scripts works similar with slackbuils, but to debian distros.
To get help just execute the scrip with param -h.
I included some scripts to clean system and tools to protect server from dictionary ssh attack.

Bug reports and suggestions is appreciated.
